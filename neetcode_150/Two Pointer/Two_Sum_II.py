# Two Integer Sum II
# Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

# There will always be exactly one valid solution.

# Your solution must use 

# O(1) additional space.

# Example 1:
# Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4], target = 3

# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation:
# The sum of 1 and 2 is 3. Since we are assuming a 1-indexed array, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

        if diff < target:
            left += 1
        elif diff > target:
            right -= 1
        else:
            return [left+1, right+1]
